Nothing much to see here.

### Thoughts

They are trying to replace the old PHP style of apps. But for standard websites, you'd probably use a CMS like Wordpress, where non-programmers / clients can go in and make changes themselves.

For actual apps, this feels too lightweight. You'll want to invest time to control the entire thing, instead of use their "quick" magical framework that's gonna hamper you long-term.

Uncanny valley of usefulness.
